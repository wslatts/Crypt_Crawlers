# Crypt Crawlers

A limited clone of the 2D game, Enter the Gungeon, developed as a group project in an undergraduate software engineering course.  The scale of game is small as prioritization was given to incorporating as many aspects of game development as possible.  All sprites, animations, dungeon floor plan, pickup tokens, music, storyline, menu, life force ticker were originally created and incorporated.  A* was utilized for the enemy search of the main player, we named Bruce.  Firing mechanisms were incorporated for Bruce upon mouse click but also for enemy reactions when in proximity of Bruce.

There are three small levels and because the game is small, it starts off with little life force.  It will take a moment to get started well.  

To run: 
Download the entire CryptCrawlersRunnable folder and run the executable from within.  You should see a Unity splash window upon boot and offered various choices for preferred quality of resolution according to your system as well as window/full screen options.
