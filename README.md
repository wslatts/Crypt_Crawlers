# Crypt Crawlers

A limited clone of the 2D game, Enter the Gungeon, developed as a group project in an undergraduate software engineering course.  The supporting game code files were created within the Unity game engine environment using C#.  The scale of game is small as prioritization was given to incorporating as many aspects of game development as possible.  All sprites, animations, dungeon floor plan, pickup tokens, music, storyline, menu, life force ticker were originally created and incorporated.  A* was utilized for the enemy search of the main player, we named Bruce.  Firing mechanisms were incorporated for Bruce upon mouse click but also for enemy reactions when in proximity of Bruce.
 
---------------------

To run: 
The only download necessary to run the game is the entire CryptCrawlersRunnable folder.  Simply run the executable from within.  You should see a Unity splash window upon boot and offered various choices for preferred quality of resolution according to your system as well as window/full screen options. There are three small levels and because the game is small, it starts off with little life force.  It will take a moment to get started well. Enjoy!

There is an additional viewable video demonstrating the AI and shooting mechanisms incorporated into the game as my component to the overall project presentation and of which I no longer have access to the entire group combined video, unfortunately.
