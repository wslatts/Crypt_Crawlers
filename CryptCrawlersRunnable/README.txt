To Run:
Download the entire CryptCrawlersRunnable folder and run the executable from within.  
You should see a Unity splash window and be offered various quality resolution for the game 
and if you prefer to open it full screen or within a window, etc. 


Note: This game is a limited clone of Enter the Gungeon.  
There are three small levels.  The goal was to incorporate as many game attributes as possible 
and leave room to expand, but the limited time in one semester was not enough to grow the game out further.  



Hope you enjoy!
